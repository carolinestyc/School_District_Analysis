# School_District_Analysis
Challenge 4
## Project Overview
Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for the City School District, has hired me to analyze standardized testing scores and funding to share with the School Board and Superindent to aid budget and teaching decisions. She has tasked me with aggregating the data and showcasing trends in school performance across the district at the school and grade level. She is looking for these key data points:
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format,
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format,
- and tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - School performance based on the budget per student
    - School performance based on the school size
    - School performance based on the type of school
